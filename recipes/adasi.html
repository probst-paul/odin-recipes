    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Adasi is a traditional Persian lentil dish known for its warmth, 
        simplicity, and comforting flavor. Made with slow-cooked lentils, 
        caramelized onions, and a blend of turmeric and spices, this version 
        adds a drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon for extra depth. 
        It’s a hearty, wholesome, and flavorful meal that's perfect for 
        breakfast, lunch, or a light dinner—especially with warm flatbread on the side.</p>
